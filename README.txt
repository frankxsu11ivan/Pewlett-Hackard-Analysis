Overview of Module 7.
Module 7 in data set modeling started with relationship diagrams map (ERDs). 
ERDS are great for keeping a high level of organization in starting to organize thoughts for code. 
the focus is SQLS and using joins to create tables perform queries.
---Main SQL Commands include 
---select == retrieve (although retrieve is only brought up in the challenge and did not locate as language in the module), 
---from, 
---join on,
---group by,
---order by,
---where == filtering.
---distinct on returns non duplicated values from a SQL query.
Distinct on clause had to be googled as the notes in the module are nor located.

	Joining tables on primary key is intuitive once a bit of practice occurred in the module. 
	Getting alias simplifies code. 
	The SQL query is saved in VSC.

---Project Overview of the analysis
	the ERD is created as a roadmap for analyzing the data. 
	Pewlett Hackard has a lot of employees getting ready to retire. 
	This is going to create a considerable amount of openings at Pewlett Hackard. 
	The data will be filtered from where commands and tables created from join commands. 
	The data shows Pewlett Hackard is ready for a take over as the company is top heavy with retiring senior engineers that will be lowering salaries in departments. 
	Younger engineers with fresh ideas will be ready to take Pewlett Hackard to the next level. 
	These young engineers will need to be mentored and the senior staff that have worked up through the ranks have golden handcuffs and will be able to mentor the next generation.


---Deliverable 3, two questions: 
•	Question: How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? Answer: Downsizing during covid sent most young to sharpen skills at a boot camp. The re-tiring roles will not need to be filled as projects are shelfed. 
•	Question: Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Answer: there are enough mentors to guide the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. The hybrid model of zoom calls, prework at home, classes at home and in persons classes will have the remaining mentors work efficiently in the new-normal mentorship program.

---Results. 
Bulleted results list with major points from the retiring employee analysis deliverable.
Available positions: engineer (428) + senior engineers (256) + assistant engineers (64) = 748 positions. 
•	Available positions: staff( 453) + senior staff (271) = 724
•	Result: there is opportunity for remaining engineers to cross train as staff and have hands on experience.
	Bulleted results list with major points from the employees eligible for mentorship program
	analysis deliverable.

•	Available eligible positions: 1550. Enough positions for re-tooling with out re-hiring.
•	Result: there is opportunity for remaining engineers to cross train as staff in all departments.
	continuing to build on their data analyst skills.

---unsolicted recommendation:
	Do not hire more employees.
	Mobilize a hybrid mentorship training program
	implement a cross training program.
